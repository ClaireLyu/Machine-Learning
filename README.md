### Machine-Learning
I was a Machine Learning researcher in PARISlab at UCLA. This is a project I worked on during Spring 2020. I cleaned the data and applied Machine Learning models to predict the properties of materials using two programming languages (R and Python). I have summarized some of my findings in the powerpoint.
